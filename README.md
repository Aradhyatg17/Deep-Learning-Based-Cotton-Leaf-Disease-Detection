# Deep-Learning-Based-Cotton-Leaf-Disease-Detection
The aim of the project was to classify images of cotton leaves/plants as diseased cotton leaf, fresh cotton leaf, diseased cotton plant, or fresh cotton plant 
by using 3 different deep learning algorithms namely CNN, Inception V3, and Resnet 152V2. The dataset called 'Cotton Disease Dataset' was taken from Kaggle, 
as the dataset was an image dataset we used data augmentation as preprocessing technique and then applied all 3 algorithms and finally compared the accuracy of each 
one of them. Among 3 CNN provided the highest test accuracy of 99.057.
